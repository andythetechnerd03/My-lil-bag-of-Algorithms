## Problem Introduction
How many SCCs (Strongly Connected Components) are there in a Directed Graph?

## Problem Description
### Task
Compute the number of strongly connected components of a given directed graph with 𝑛 vertices and 𝑚 edges.
### Input Format
A graph is given in the standard format.
### Constraints
1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 104, 0 ≤ 𝑚 ≤ 104.
### Output Format
Output the number of strongly connected components.
## Sample 1.
### Input:
4 4 <br>
1 2 <br>
4 1 <br>
2 3 <br>
3 1 <br>
### Output: <br>
2 <br>
