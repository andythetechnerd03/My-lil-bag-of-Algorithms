This exercise is initially tasked by my instructor as an example of recursion, but I kinda prefer the "classic" DP mthod :D, so I used it instead

Task: Given an integer n, output all the integers whose sum of all of its digits add up to n

Input: 3
Output: 111, 12, 21

Input: 4
Output: 112, 22, 121, 1111, 211
