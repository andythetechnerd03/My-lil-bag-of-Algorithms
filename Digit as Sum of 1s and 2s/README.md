# Represent Integer as sum of 1s and 2s

This exercise is initially tasked by my instructor as an example of recursion, but I kinda prefer the "classic" DP method :D, so I used it instead.

## Task
Given an integer n, output all the integers (consisting of only 1s and 2s) whose sum of all of its digits add up to n.

## Input
An integer n of the number that you want to represent as strings of 1s and 2s.

## Output
All possible permutations of integers whose digits all add up to the input number.

## Constrains
Integer n must be an integer, n $\leq$ 100000

## Sample Input
Input: 3 <br>
Output: 111, 12, 21

Input: 4 <br>
Output: 112, 22, 121, 1111, 211
