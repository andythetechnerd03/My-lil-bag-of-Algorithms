### STRESS TEST

This is a guide on how to perform stress test for algorithms to check the correctness and the time complexity
and hopefully compare them to pick out the most efficient one.

This technique is used in a lot of algorithm verification to check its reliability and efficiency and should be implemented every time you have completed coding
a program

In this simple guide, I will show you two different types of testing: **program correctness** and **time complexity**.
The guide shouldn't be too difficult, just a couple of libraries importing and you are set. Enjoy!
